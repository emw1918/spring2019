Materials, etc. from PHYS 4200 (introduction to physics computing).

Hello! Hello. Greetings. Welcome to this repository. Hello. Did I say that already? Sorry. I am very nervous about this class. I am very nervous in general, but particularly about classes. I'm less nervous about this class than I am about Analysis II or the 8:00am KIN class that I chose to take because I am an over-ambitious idiot, but more nervous about this class than I am about Theory of Probability (although I have so much late homework in that class, I really should be more nervous). Anyway. Hello. Welcome.
